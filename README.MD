# DisableElder
A Fabric mod that disables the elder guardian appearance effect.

## Why?
I don't like the sound effect with my headphones on. It sounds too loud to my ear. So I decided to make a mod to disable it altogether. You can already deduce from the particle effects and the potion effect icon that you have mining fatigue.

## Installation
The mod requires Fabric to function. Head to the [Fabric website](https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/) and download and install it.

Now you can download the `.jar` corresponding to your Minecraft and Fabric version from the "Releases" tab. Place it in your Fabric mods folder and you're done.

## Building
JDK 17 is a requirement for building. Clone this repository with git or download it as a zip file. Open a terminal window in the root directory of the project.You can build the mod with `gradlew`:
```bash
$ ./gradlew build
```
You can edit the code using VS Code with the Java and Gradle extensions installed.
